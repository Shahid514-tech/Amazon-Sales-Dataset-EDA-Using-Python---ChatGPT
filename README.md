## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Amazon Sales Dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to uncover insights into sales patterns and trends, identify top-selling products, and visualize key metrics such as Units Sold, Total Revenue, and Total Profit.
